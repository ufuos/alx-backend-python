# Getting Started with Python Generators

## 📌 Project Overview

This project introduces **Python Generators** by applying them in a real-world use case:  
**streaming rows from an SQL database one by one.**

The project sets up a MySQL database called `ALX_prodev`, seeds it with data from a CSV file (`user_data.csv`), and provides utility functions to connect, create, and insert data into the database.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Learn how to use Python to connect to a MySQL database.
- Create and populate a database using a seed script (`seed.py`).
- Understand how generators can stream database records efficiently.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- MySQL server
- `mysql-connector-python` (or `pymysql`)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
